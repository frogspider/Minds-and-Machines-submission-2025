Action data used for training:  True
Post-criteria data used for training:  False
Computed metric:  generational distance + confusion matrix
--- ---
Generational distance for classifier  Logistic Regression :  1.894 + 0.017
Confusion matrix  for classifier  Logistic Regression :  [0.896, 0.104, 0.166, 0.834] + [0.018, 0.018, 0.025, 0.025]
The order in confusion matrix is : true negatives, false positives, false negatives, true positives (all normalised) 
Generational distance for classifier  Random dummy :  2.612 + 0.066
Confusion matrix  for classifier  Random dummy :  [0.678, 0.322, 0.68, 0.32] + [0.016, 0.016, 0.02, 0.02]
The order in confusion matrix is : true negatives, false positives, false negatives, true positives (all normalised)
